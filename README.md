## Project Overview

This repository documents an ongoing B.Tech design credit course group project under Dr. V Narayanan at IIT Jodhpur, focused on Single Photon Pixel camera imaging and the use of Convolutional Neural Networks to reconstruct the image based on measurements provided by the camera.

## Project Highlights

- Literature Review: Acquired knowledge in single-pixel imaging, modulation and sampling strategies, CS, and CGI through an extensive literature review.
- Deep Learning Integration: Explored the application of deep learning, specifically transfer learned CNN, for image reconstruction. Investigated how this approach compares to traditional methods in terms of measurement efficiency.
